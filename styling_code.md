Bios-- small but important computer component. Input/Output system
First program to run when computer starts up. Boots operating systems.

Class- A class is a blueprint/ template that defines what an object can be. Hold methods and properties.

Object-- An instance of a class

Instantiate tiger class 

Methods are function defined in class body that provide functionality.

Encapsulation restricts access to methods and variables.
underscore denotes "private attrbue "

# Style Tips
Avoid complexity and aim for simplicity

## **The Zen of Python** by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.

Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

# Pep
## Indentation
- 4 spaces per indentation level recommended
- Space improves readability and leaves room for multiple levels of indentation on each Line
- Be careful about mixing tabs and spaces!
## Line Length
- Lines should be less than 80 characters long
- Limit comments to 72 characters per line
## Blank Lines
- Use blank lines to organize your files
- Don't use excessive blank lines!
- Blank lines won't affect how code runs (python disregards vertical spacing), but significantly affects readability
